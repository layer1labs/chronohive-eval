# AEE Challenge

Challenge explicit claims for observability, atomicity, boundaries, falsifiability, evidence independence, provenance, missing dependencies, cycles, and contradictions.

## User input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Resolve `artifact=<path>` and optional `phase=<phase>` using the same prerequisites and path rules as `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_AEE_ASSESS__`. Run the AEE adapter's `challenge` operation, which emits a deterministic failure-mode projection (failures plus bounded recovery proposals) rather than aggregate scoring.

```bash
python .specify/extensions/aee/scripts/python/run_aee.py challenge --input <artifact> --phase <phase>
```

For every failure in the emitted projection, report:

- stable failure and claim IDs;
- the deterministic challenge that triggered;
- the inspectable breakpoint;
- evidence references and their kinds;
- a bounded recovery action and how its completion can be verified.

Never delete a conflicting position, manufacture evidence, or accept model self-attestation as independent support. Recommend rerunning `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_AEE_ASSESS__` after recovery work changes the source artifact.
